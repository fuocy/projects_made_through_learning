# OLD OMNIFOOD PROJECT

This project is my very first project with HTML and CSS. However, I don't consider myself to have a good grasp of HTML and CSS already, so I decided a take another course about HTML and CSS.

Course: Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS Version 1

Time taking this course: 5/7/2021 -20/7/2021
